# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 18, 2020 (Day 0)
##### (Getting some initial work done)

**Today's Progress**: Updated some dev dependencies, initialized an important project and looked over some documentation.

**Thoughts:** I made some decent progress for the day, but I can do much better.

**Link to work:** [RapidMiner Extension](https://github.com/Lonero-Team/RapidMiner-Extension)

### Day 1: August 19, 2020 (Day 1)
##### (Starting out w/ Sheetsu)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed some dev dependencies, created a Sheetsu account for a project and started looking over some API documentation. Also created a hpool config file.

**Thoughts**: It was a long day today, and I was a bit tired to get that much work done.

### Day 2: August 20, 2020 (Day 2)
##### (Not too progressive of a day)

**Today's Progress**: Updated some dependencies and read over some documentation for something related to file configs, that is basically it.

**Thoughts**: Today was extremely long, so the work done wasn't much.

### Day 3: August 21, 2020 (Day 3)
##### (Not much progress)

**Today's Progress**: Another long day, just had time to update some dependencies.

**Thoughts**: Today was extremely tedious.

### Day 4: August 22, 2020 (Day 4)
##### (Some more intial work done)

**Today's Progress**: Updated some dev dependencies  
ðŸ“˜ Looked over some old documentation and "discovered" some stuff  
ðŸ“š Studied recursion in programming and data structures  
ðŸ§® Doing work related to mathematical logic  
ðŸ“… Planning work I want to get done out

**Thoughts**: At least I have been starting to pick up pace.

### Day 5: August 23, 2020 (Day 5)
##### (Working w/ Jupyter)

**Today's Progress**: Started getting more used to Embeded Jupyter  
ðŸ’» Worked with an interactive IPython Notebook Environment  
ðŸ“Š Looked over some data view explorers and demos

**Thoughts**: Started getting more used to an initial dev pace for this project. *Sidenote: May need to start doing some "sidechain development", also Lonero's ReadtheDocs likely needs expanding. More info needing on Hardware, Peertop, Architecture, Protocol, Masternode Concensus, etc. Projects that have been on hold for a while in relation to other things need to be revamped. May also start doing some stuff w/ Matcha Notebook (Papers).*
