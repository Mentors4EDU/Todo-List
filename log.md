### Day 1: August 19, 2020 (Day 1)
##### (Starting out w/ Sheetsu)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed some dev dependencies, created a Sheetsu account for a project and started looking over some API documentation. Also created a hpool config file.

### Day 2: August 20, 2020 (Day 2)
##### (Not too progressive of a day)

**Today's Progress**: Updated some dependencies and read over some documentation for something related to file configs, that is basically it.

##### (Some more intial work done)

**Today's Progress**: Updated some dev dependencies  
üìò Looked over some old documentation and "discovered" some stuff  
üìö Studied recursion in programming and data structures  
üßÆ Doing work related to mathematical logic  
üìÖ Planning work I want to get done out

**Thoughts**: At least I have been starting to pick up pace.

### Day 5: August 23, 2020 (Day 5)
##### (Working w/ Jupyter)

**Today's Progress**: Started getting more used to Embeded Jupyter  
üñãÔ∏è Finally started a language.yml for LonScript, was small but had to be done.  
üóíÔ∏è Created a "draft notebooks page" + nbviewer experimentation  
üíª Worked with an interactive IPython Notebook Environment  
üìä Looked over some data view explorers and demos  
üìÑ Experimented with ipynb markup for a bit

**Thoughts**: Started getting more used to an initial dev pace for this project. *Sidenote: May need to start doing some "sidechain development", also Lonero's ReadtheDocs likely needs expanding. More info needing on Hardware, Peertop, Architecture, Protocol, Masternode Concensus, etc. Projects that have been on hold for a while in relation to other things need to be revamped. May also start doing some stuff w/ Matcha Notebook (Papers).*
